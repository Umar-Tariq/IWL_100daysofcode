                <h3>The most iconic fashion designers of all time</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Fashion is more than just clothing—it's an expression of individuality, culture, and creativity. The best fashion designers have elevated this art form, creating timeless pieces that continue to inspire and shape the world of style. These designers have not only influenced trends but also established themselves as leaders in innovation, creativity, and craftsmanship.

                <h2>Coco Chanel</h2>
                <p>
                    A name synonymous with elegance and sophistication, Coco Chanel revolutionized women’s fashion by introducing simple yet stylish designs. Her little black dress, quilted handbags, and timeless Chanel suit remain wardrobe staples to this day.

                <p>
                    Christian Dior is the mastermind behind the "New Look," a fashion movement that redefined femininity in the post-war era. With cinched waists, full skirts, and an ultra-feminine silhouette, Dior's designs symbolized a return to luxury. His influence remains prominent today, as Dior continues to be a leading fashion house known for glamorous, high-fashion looks.

His use of bold prints, luxurious fabrics, and fearless designs made Versace a symbol of high-octane glamour. His legacy lives on in the Versace brand, which continues to dominate global fashion.

                <h2>Alexander McQueen</h2>
                <p>
                    Alexander McQueen was a visionary who pushed the boundaries of fashion. His designs were theatrical, often shocking, but always impeccably crafted. Known for his dark, dramatic, and avant-garde aesthetic, McQueen’s work combined cutting-edge design with a deep understanding of tailoring and craftsmanship.
